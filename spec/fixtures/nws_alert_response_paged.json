Prepare for limited wind damage.\n- ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind\nbecomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees\nare shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown\nover.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within\nurban or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving\nconditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- No storm surge inundation forecast\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Little to no storm surge\nflooding\n- PLAN: There is little to no threat of storm surge flooding.\nRough surf, coastal erosion, and life-threatening rip\ncurrents are possible.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations for storm surge flooding\nare needed.\n- ACT: Follow the instructions of local officials. Monitor\nforecasts.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from storm surge flooding.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Flash Flood Watch is in effect\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter\ncurrents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches\noverflow.\n- Several places may experience expanded areas of rapid\ninundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving\nwater as storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving\nconditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Tornadoes not expected\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected.

Poor conditions are also likely on Highway 41 between\nGreen Bay and Marinette. If you encounter dense fog, slow down,\nkeep a safe distance from the car ahead of you, and use your low\nbeam headlights.\n\nConditions should begin to improve across the entire area by mid-\nmorning.",

Some of the rain will be locally heavy\nespecially along and south of a Wharton to Houston to Cleveland\nline. Widespread rainfall by Wednesday morning will average\nbetween 1 and 3 inches with isolated totals between 4 and 6\ninches possible in areas where training of storms develop.\n\n* The Flash Flood Watch will probably need to be extended through\nWednesday night over parts of Southeast Texas and may also need\nto be expanded further north.\n\n* Do not drive your vehicle into areas where the water covers the\nroadway. The water depth may be too great to allow your car to\ncross safely. Vehicles caught in rising water should be\nabandoned quickly. If your vehicle stalls...abandon it and seek\nhigher ground immediately. Rapidly rising water may engulf your\nvehicle and its occupants and sweep them away. Move to higher\nground.",

A Code Orange forecast indicates that ground level ozone\nconcentrations are expected to be unhealthy for sensitive groups,\nwhich includes people with lung disease, older adults and children.\nSensitive groups should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion,\ntake more breaks, and do less intense activities, especially during\nafternoon and early evening hours. You can help prevent ozone\npollution by carpooling, walking or riding your bicycle, taking your\nlunch to work, reducing idling, conserving energy, and keeping your\nvehicle properly tuned.

This system\nis expected to bring another round of significant rainfall to the\nregion Tuesday. Expected rainfall totals from the system Tuesday\nappear to be similar, if not slightly higher than Sunday's front.\n\nGusty south winds can be expected Tuesday, both along the coast\nand inland. Gusts along the coast may approach 50 mph along the\nbeaches and headlands, making this the first significantly windy\ncold front of the season. Inland areas, including the Willamette\nValley, may experience gusts as high as 35 mph Tuesday.\n\nThose planning to spend time in the Cascades should be prepared\nfor an extended period of autumn-like weather that will last\nthrough at least Wednesday. Snow levels are expected to lower to\n6000 to 7000 feet with the passage of the cold front Tuesday and\nTuesday night. Even if it is not cold enough to snow, those in the\nCascades should be prepared for more cold, raw, wet weather\nthrough at least Wednesday.\n\nFor more information on this ongoing damp and chilly weather,\nvisit our website at www.weather.gov/portland, or stay tuned to\nyour favorite source of weather information.",

Most locations received one-half to three-\nquarters of an inch of rain, while coastal and higher terrain\nlocations locally received an inch or more.\n\nAfter post-frontal showers and isolated thunderstorms Monday, the\nnext frontal system will be quick on its heels, spreading rain\nonshore into southern Washington by sunrise Tuesday. This system\nis expected to bring another round of significant rainfall to the\nregion Tuesday. Expected rainfall totals from the system Tuesday\nappear to be similar, if not slightly higher than Sunday's front.\n\nGusty south winds can be expected Tuesday, both along the coast\nand inland. Gusts along the coast may approach 50 mph along the\nbeaches and headlands, making this the first significantly windy\ncold front of the season. Inland areas, including the Willamette\nValley, may experience gusts as high as 35 mph Tuesday.\n\nThose planning to spend time in the Cascades should be prepared\nfor an extended period of autumn-like weather that will last\nthrough at least Wednesday. Snow levels are expected to lower to\n6000 to 7000 feet with the passage of the cold front Tuesday and\nTuesday night. Even if it is not cold enough to snow, those in the\nCascades should be prepared for more cold, raw, wet weather\nthrough at least Wednesday.\n\nFor more information on this ongoing damp and chilly weather,\nvisit our website at www.weather.gov/portland, or stay tuned to\nyour favorite source of weather information.",
